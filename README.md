## Overview  
Air travel is considered one of the safest modes of transportation, however accidents still happens. • This project aims to analyze aviation accident data to identify trends across the world among different plane makes and models.
The data set comprises of over 80,000 investigated aviation accidents and incidents.

## Business Understanding 
Business Problem: My company is expanding into the aviation industry but lacks insights into aircraft safety risks. This analysis identifies the lowest-risk aircraft models for commercial and private use.
 
### objectives
1.Which aircraft models have the highest fatality rates?

2.Try and find the leading cause of aviation accidents?

3.Trends in aviation fatalities over the years?

4.Recomend actions to help mitigate/prevent aviation accidents and incidents ?

## Data cleaning and processing 
• Removing missing values and inconsistencies. 

• Standardized column names for uniformity. 

• Converted necessary data types (e.g., Date format).

• Number of aviation accidents has fluctuated over the years. 

• Recent trends indicate improved safety measures.

## Recommendations
Our data illuminates the average trend fetal aero plane accidences occurred in the early adoption years. As technology got better over the years accidence happened less often.
Aviation accidents and incidents usually result from a chain of factors rather than a single cause. Effective prevention and mitigation require actions across people, technology, procedures, and culture.
